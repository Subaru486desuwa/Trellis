# Development Workflow

---

## Core Principles

1. **Plan before code** — figure out what to do before you start
2. **Specs injected, not remembered** — guidelines are injected via hook/skill, not recalled from memory
3. **Persist everything** — research, decisions, and lessons all go to files; conversations get compacted, files don't
4. **Incremental development** — one task at a time
5. **Capture learnings** — after each task, review and write new knowledge back to spec

---

## Trellis System

### Developer Identity

On first use, initialize your identity:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/init_developer.py <your-name>
```

Creates `.trellis/.developer` (gitignored) + `.trellis/workspace/<your-name>/`.

### Spec System

`.trellis/spec/` holds coding guidelines organized by package and layer.

- `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` — entry point with **Pre-Development Checklist** + **Quality Check**. Actual guidelines live in the `.md` files it points to.
- `.trellis/spec/guides/index.md` — cross-package thinking guides.

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages   # list packages / layers
```

**When to update spec**: new pattern/convention found · bug-fix prevention to codify · new technical decision.

### Task System

Every task has its own directory under `.trellis/tasks/{MM-DD-name}/` holding `prd.md`, `implement.jsonl`, `check.jsonl`, `task.json`, optional `research/`, `info.md`.

```bash
# Task lifecycle
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<title>" [--slug <name>] [--parent <dir>]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <name>          # set active task (session-scoped when available)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source      # show active task and source
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py finish                # clear active task (triggers after_finish hooks)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py archive <name>        # move to archive/{year-month}/
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list [--mine] [--status <s>]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-archive

# Code-spec context (injected into implement/check agents via JSONL).
# `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` are seeded on `task create` for sub-agent-capable
# platforms; the AI curates real spec + research entries during Phase 1.3.
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context <name> <action> <file> <reason>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-context <name> [action]
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py validate <name>

# Task metadata
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-branch <name> <branch>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-base-branch <name> <branch>    # PR target
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-scope <name> <scope>

# Hierarchy (parent/child)
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>

# PR creation
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create-pr [name] [--dry-run]
```

> Run `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py --help` to see the authoritative, up-to-date list.

**Current-task mechanism**: `task.py create` creates the task directory and (when session identity is available) auto-sets the per-session active-task pointer so the planning breadcrumb fires immediately. `task.py start` writes the same pointer (idempotent if already set) and flips `task.json.status` from `planning` to `in_progress`. State is stored under `.trellis/.runtime/sessions/`. If no context key is available from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or a platform-native session environment variable, there is no active task and `task.py start` fails with a session identity hint. `task.py finish` deletes the current session file (status unchanged). `task.py archive <task>` writes `status=completed`, moves the directory to `archive/`, and deletes any runtime session files that still point at the archived task.

### Workspace System

Records every AI session for cross-session tracking under `.trellis/workspace/<developer>/`.

- `journal-N.md` — session log. **Max 2000 lines per file**; a new `journal-(N+1).md` is auto-created when exceeded.
- `index.md` — personal index (total sessions, last active).

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/add_session.py --title "Title" --commit "hash" --summary "Summary"
```

### Context Script

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py                            # full session runtime
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages            # available packages + spec layers
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <X.Y>  # detailed guide for a workflow step
```

<!--
  WORKFLOW-STATE BREADCRUMB CONTRACT (read this before editing the tag blocks below)

  The 4 [workflow-state:STATUS] blocks embedded in the ## Phase Index section
  below are the SINGLE source of truth for the per-turn `<workflow-state>`
  breadcrumb that every supported AI platform's UserPromptSubmit hook
  reads. inject-workflow-state.py (Python platforms) and
  inject-workflow-state.js (OpenCode plugin) only parse them — there is no
  fallback dict baked into the scripts after v0.5.0-rc.0.

  STATUS charset: [A-Za-z0-9_-]+. When the hook can't find a tag, it
  degrades to a generic "Refer to workflow.md for current step." line —
  intentionally visible so users notice and fix a broken workflow.md.

  INVARIANT (test/regression.test.ts):
    Every workflow-walkthrough step marked `[required · once]` must have a
    matching enforcement line in its phase's [workflow-state:*] block. The
    breadcrumb is the only per-turn channel; if a mandatory step isn't
    mentioned there, the AI silently skips it (Phase 1.3 jsonl curation
    skip and Phase 3.4 commit skip both manifested via this gap).

  TAG ↔ PHASE scoping:
    [workflow-state:no_task]      → no active task; before Phase 1
    [workflow-state:planning]     → all of Phase 1 (status='planning')
    [workflow-state:in_progress]  → Phase 2 + Phase 3.1-3.4
                                    (status stays 'in_progress' from
                                    task.py start until task.py archive)
    [workflow-state:completed]    → currently DEAD: cmd_archive flips
                                    status and moves the dir in the same
                                    call, so the resolver loses the
                                    pointer (block kept for a future
                                    explicit in_progress→completed
                                    transition)

  DISPATCH-MODE VARIANTS (resolve_breadcrumb_key picks one per platform/config):
    [workflow-state:<status>-inline] → codex inline dispatch_mode (main session
                                       edits code directly); codex-only.
    [workflow-state:<status>-ultra]  → ultracode fan-out (config
                                       ultracode.enabled), class-1 platforms
                                       only. Only planning / in_progress carry
                                       ultra bodies; any other <status>-ultra
                                       falls back to the base status via
                                       build_breadcrumb. Codex and ultracode are
                                       mutually exclusive — resolve_breadcrumb_key
                                       returns inside the codex branch before the
                                       ultracode check, so no -inline-ultra
                                       combination ever exists.

  Editing checklist:
    - When you change a [workflow-state:STATUS] block, also check the
      matching phase's `[required · once]` walkthrough steps for sync
    - Run `trellis update` after editing to push the new bodies to
      downstream user projects (block-level managed replacement)
    - Full runtime contract:

## Phase Index

```
Phase 1: Plan    → figure out what to do (brainstorm + research → prd.md)
Phase 2: Execute → write code and pass quality checks
Phase 3: Finish  → distill lessons + wrap-up
```

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown when there is no active task (before Phase 1) -->

[workflow-state:no_task]
No active task. Judge the turn's real size yourself:
- Multi-turn implementation work, or anything worth a persistent record → `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<title>"`, brainstorm into prd.md, then `task.py start <task-dir>`.
- Questions, quick fixes, one-shot edits → answer or do them inline; no task ceremony. If an inline change grows beyond expectations, create the task at that point.
[/workflow-state:no_task]

### Phase 1: Plan
- 1.0 Create task `[required · once]` (just `task.py create`; status enters planning)
- 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]`
- 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`
- 1.3 Configure context `[sub-agent dispatch only · once]` — Cursor, OpenCode, Codex (sub-agent mode), Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi
- 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]` (run `task.py start`; status → in_progress)
- 1.5 Completion criteria

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown throughout Phase 1 (status='planning') -->

[workflow-state:planning]
Iterate on prd.md with the user (the `trellis-brainstorm` skill has the template); persist research to `{task_dir}/research/` — files survive compaction, chat doesn't.
Phase 1.3 (only if Phase 2 will dispatch sub-agents): curate `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` so sub-agents get spec context injected. Working inline (the default)? Skip it.
When the prd is settled, run `task.py start <task-dir>`.
**Ultracode**: if this turn shows an "Ultracode is on" system-reminder, research may fan out per the "Trellis × Ultracode" section.
[/workflow-state:planning]

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown throughout Phase 1 when codex.dispatch_mode=inline.
     Codex-only opt-in alternate to [workflow-state:planning]. The main agent
     edits code directly in Phase 2, so Phase 1.3 jsonl curation is skipped —
     the inline workflow loads `trellis-before-dev` instead of injecting JSONL
     into a sub-agent. -->

[workflow-state:planning-inline]
Iterate on prd.md with the user; persist research to `{task_dir}/research/`. jsonl curation is skipped in inline mode — you read spec context yourself in Phase 2.
When the prd is settled, run `task.py start <task-dir>`.
[/workflow-state:planning-inline]

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown throughout Phase 1 when ultracode is on
     (config ultracode.enabled, resolved by inject-workflow-state.py's
     resolve_breadcrumb_key for class-1 platforms). Ultracode fan-out
     variant of [workflow-state:planning]: research fans out via the Workflow
     tool. Phase 1.3 jsonl curation is still required (regression invariant). -->

[workflow-state:planning-ultra]
Iterate on prd.md with the user. Ultracode is on: when research splits into independent angles, fan out parallel `trellis-research` agents via the Workflow tool, each dispatch prompt starting with `Active task: <task path from \`task.py current\`>`; trivial planning turns need no fan-out.
Phase 1.3 (only if Phase 2 will dispatch sub-agents): curate `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` after the parallel research lands. Working inline? Skip it.
When the prd is settled, run `task.py start <task-dir>`.
[/workflow-state:planning-ultra]

### Phase 2: Execute
- 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress'.
     Scope: all of Phase 2 + Phase 3.1-3.4 (status stays 'in_progress' from
     task.py start until task.py archive; only archive flips it). The body
     therefore must cover every required step from implementation through
     commit, including Phase 3.3 spec update and Phase 3.4 commit. -->

[workflow-state:in_progress]
Implement in the main session by default — you hold the full conversation context. Read `{task_dir}/prd.md` + `research/` and the relevant `.trellis/spec/` guides before coding; run lint / type-check / tests before reporting done.
Sub-agents (`trellis-implement` / `trellis-check` / `trellis-research` via the Task/Agent tool; `trellis-check` and `trellis-update-spec` also exist as skills) are optional tools for parallelizable or context-heavy chunks — not a required pipeline. **Sub-agent dispatch protocol (all platforms, all sub-agents)**: the dispatch prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path from \`task.py current\`>` — for `trellis-research` this resolves which `{task_dir}/research/` to write into. Sub-agents never run git commit/push/merge; if you ARE one, work directly — don't spawn another.
Then commit (Phase 3.4): the main session states the commit plan, lists unrecognized dirty files for the user to include/exclude (never silently commit them), runs `git commit` — no `--amend`, no push. Wrap up with `/trellis:finish-work` (it refuses to run on a dirty working tree).
**Ultracode**: if this turn shows an "Ultracode is on" system-reminder, verification may fan out per the "Trellis × Ultracode" section; the commit stays main-driven.
[/workflow-state:in_progress]

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress' when
     codex.dispatch_mode=inline. Codex-only opt-in alternate to
     [workflow-state:in_progress]. The main session edits code directly
     instead of dispatching sub-agents. -->

[workflow-state:in_progress-inline]
Main session edits code directly (inline mode — no trellis-implement / trellis-check sub-agents). Read `{task_dir}/prd.md` + `research/` and relevant `.trellis/spec/` guides before coding; lint / type-check / tests before reporting done.
Then commit (Phase 3.4): state the commit plan, list unrecognized dirty files for the user to include/exclude, run `git commit` — no `--amend`, no push. Wrap up with `/trellis:finish-work` (it refuses to run on a dirty working tree).
[/workflow-state:in_progress-inline]

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress' when ultracode is on
     (config ultracode.enabled, class-1 platforms). Ultracode fan-out variant
     of [workflow-state:in_progress]: check fans out across review dimensions via
     the Workflow tool; implement stays single by default. Covers the same
     required steps as the base block — Phase 3.4 commit stays main-driven
     (regression invariant). Codex never reaches this variant (see
     resolve_breadcrumb_key). -->

[workflow-state:in_progress-ultra]
**Trivial turn — answer directly, no fan-out**: pure Q&A / status checks / one-line fixes get a direct answer at full reasoning depth; fan-out is for substantive implement / verify work.
Ultracode is on: for real verification, fan out `trellis-check` agents via the Workflow tool — one per review dimension (see the "Trellis × Ultracode" section for the pipeline template) — and reconcile findings in the main session. Implement stays single by default; fan out `trellis-implement` only when the prd splits into independent, non-overlapping units (worktree isolation, experimental). Every dispatch prompt starts with `Active task: <task path from \`task.py current\`>`, repo-root relative; Workflow agents self-load prd + jsonl (no hook injection), and check fan-out runs at repo root, not in a worktree. Workflow agents never run `git commit` / `push` / `merge`.
**Sub-agent self-exemption**: if you are already a trellis-implement / trellis-check worker, do the work directly — no further fan-out.
After checks reconcile green, the MAIN session drives the commit (Phase 3.4) — commit plan in user-facing text, unrecognized dirty files confirmed with the user, `git commit`, no `--amend`, no push — then `/trellis:finish-work`. If implement fan-out used worktrees, merge them back into the task branch first.
[/workflow-state:in_progress-ultra]

### Phase 3: Finish
- 3.1 Quality verification `[required · repeatable]`
- 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`
- 3.3 Spec update `[required · once]`
- 3.4 Commit changes `[required · once]`
- 3.5 Wrap-up reminder

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='completed'.
     Currently DEAD in normal flow: cmd_archive writes status='completed' in
     the same call that moves the task dir to archive/, so the active-task
     resolver loses the pointer and the hook never fires on archived tasks.
     Block preserved for a future status-transition redesign (e.g. an
     explicit in_progress→completed command). Edit through the same spec
     channel as the live blocks. -->

[workflow-state:completed]
Code committed via Phase 3.4; run `/trellis:finish-work` to wrap up (archive the task + record session).
If you reach this state with uncommitted code, return to Phase 3.4 first — `/finish-work` refuses to run on a dirty working tree.
`task.py archive` deletes any runtime session files that still point at the archived task.
[/workflow-state:completed]

### Rules

1. Identify which Phase you're in, then continue from the next step there
2. Run steps in order inside each Phase; `[required]` steps can't be skipped
3. Phases can roll back (e.g., Execute reveals a prd defect → return to Plan to fix, then re-enter Execute)
4. Steps tagged `[once]` are skipped if the output already exists; don't re-run

### Skill Routing

These are the default routes when a request matches an intent; deviate when you have a concrete reason.

[Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

| User intent | Route |
|---|---|
| Wants a new feature / requirement unclear | `trellis-brainstorm` |
| About to write code / start implementing | Dispatch the `trellis-implement` sub-agent per Phase 2.1 |
| Finished writing / want to verify | Dispatch the `trellis-check` sub-agent per Phase 2.2 |
| Stuck / fixed same bug several times | `trellis-break-loop` |
| Spec needs update | `trellis-update-spec` |

**Why `trellis-before-dev` is NOT in this table:** you are not the one writing code — the `trellis-implement` sub-agent is. Sub-agent platforms get spec context via `implement.jsonl` injection / prelude, not via the main thread loading `trellis-before-dev`.

[/Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

[Claude Code, codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]

| User intent | Skill |
|---|---|
| Wants a new feature / requirement unclear | `trellis-brainstorm` |
| About to write code / start implementing | `trellis-before-dev` (then implement directly in the main session) |
| Finished writing / want to verify | `trellis-check` |
| Stuck / fixed same bug several times | `trellis-break-loop` |
| Spec needs update | `trellis-update-spec` |

[/Claude Code, codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]

### Loading Step Detail

At each step, run this to fetch detailed guidance:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <step>
# e.g. python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step 1.1
```

---

## Phase 1: Plan

Goal: figure out what to build, produce a clear requirements doc and the context needed to implement it.

#### 1.0 Create task `[required · once]`

Create the task directory (status enters `planning`, the session active-task pointer auto-targets the new task when session identity is available):

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<task title>" --slug <name>
```

`--slug` is the human-readable name only. Do **not** include the `MM-DD-` date prefix; `task.py create` adds that prefix automatically.

After this command succeeds, the per-turn breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:planning]`, telling the AI to enter the brainstorm + jsonl curation phase.

⚠️ **Run only `create` here — do not also run `start`**. `start` flips status to `in_progress`, which switches the breadcrumb to the implementation phase before brainstorm + jsonl are done — the AI will silently skip them. Save `start` for step 1.4, after jsonl curation is complete.

Skip when `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source` already points to a task.

#### 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]`

Load the `trellis-brainstorm` skill and explore requirements interactively with the user per the skill's guidance.

The brainstorm skill will guide you to:
- Ask one question at a time
- Prefer researching over asking the user
- Prefer offering options over open-ended questions
- Update `prd.md` immediately after each user answer

Return to this step whenever requirements change and revise `prd.md`.

#### 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`

Research can happen at any time during requirement exploration. It isn't limited to local code — you can use any available tool (MCP servers, skills, web search, etc.) to look up external information, including third-party library docs, industry practices, API references, etc.

[Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

Spawn the research sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-research`
- **Task description**: Research <specific question>
- **Key requirement**: Research output MUST be persisted to `{TASK_DIR}/research/`

[/Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

[Claude Code, codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]

Do the research in the main session directly and write findings into `{TASK_DIR}/research/`. (For `codex-inline` this avoids the `fork_turns="none"` isolation that prevents `trellis-research` sub-agents from resolving the active task path.)

[/Claude Code, codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]

**Research artifact conventions**:
- One file per research topic (e.g. `research/auth-library-comparison.md`)
- Record third-party library usage examples, API references, version constraints in files
- Note relevant spec file paths you discovered for later reference

Brainstorm and research can interleave freely — pause to research a technical question, then return to talk with the user.

**Key principle**: Research output must be written to files, not left only in the chat. Conversations get compacted; files don't.

#### 1.3 Configure context `[sub-agent dispatch only · once]`

[Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

Curate `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` so the Phase 2 sub-agents get the right spec context. These files were seeded on `task create` with a single self-describing `_example` line; your job here is to fill in real entries.

**Location**: `{TASK_DIR}/implement.jsonl` and `{TASK_DIR}/check.jsonl` (already exist).

**Format**: one JSON object per line — `{"file": "<path>", "reason": "<why>"}`. Paths are repo-root relative.

**What to put in**:
- **Spec files** — `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` and any specific guideline files (`error-handling.md`, `conventions.md`, etc.) relevant to this task
- **Research files** — `{TASK_DIR}/research/*.md` that the sub-agent will need to consult

**What NOT to put in**:
- Code files (`src/**`, `packages/**/*.ts`, etc.) — those are read by the sub-agent during implementation, not pre-registered here
- Files you're about to modify — same reason

**Split between the two files**:
- `implement.jsonl` → specs + research the implement sub-agent needs to write code correctly
- `check.jsonl` → specs for the check sub-agent (quality guidelines, check conventions, same research if needed)

**How to discover relevant specs**:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages
```

Lists every package + its spec layers with paths. Pick the entries that match this task's domain.

**How to append entries**:

Either edit the jsonl file directly in your editor, or use:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" implement "<path>" "<reason>"
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" check "<path>" "<reason>"
```

Delete the seed `_example` line once real entries exist (optional — it's skipped automatically by consumers).

Skip when: `implement.jsonl` has agent-curated entries (the seed row alone doesn't count).

[/Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

[Claude Code, codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]

Skip this step. Context is loaded directly by the `trellis-before-dev` skill in Phase 2.

[/Claude Code, codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]

#### 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]`

Once prd.md is complete and 1.3 jsonl curation is done, flip the task status to `in_progress`:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <task-dir>
```

After this command succeeds, the breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:in_progress]`, and the rest of Phase 2 / 3 follows.

If `task.py start` errors with a session-identity message (no context key from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or platform-native session env), follow the hint in the error to set up session identity, then retry.

#### 1.5 Completion criteria

| Condition | Required |
|------|:---:|
| `prd.md` exists | ✅ |
| User confirms requirements | ✅ |
| `task.py start` has been run (status = in_progress) | ✅ |
| `research/` has artifacts (complex tasks) | recommended |
| `info.md` technical design (complex tasks) | optional |

[Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

| `implement.jsonl` has agent-curated entries (not just the seed row) | ✅ |

[/Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

---

## Phase 2: Execute

Goal: turn the prd into code that passes quality checks.

#### 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`

[Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the requirements per prd.md, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish by running project lint and type-check
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: Tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-implement` sub-agent and must implement directly, not spawn another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The platform hook/plugin auto-handles:
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and injects the referenced spec files into the agent prompt
- Injects prd.md content

[/Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

[codex-sub-agent]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the requirements per prd.md, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish by running project lint and type-check
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`, then explicitly say the spawned agent is already `trellis-implement` and must implement directly without spawning another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The Codex sub-agent definition auto-handles the context load requirement:
- Resolves the active task with `task.py current --source`, then reads `prd.md` and `info.md` if present
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and requires the agent to load each referenced spec file before coding

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the requirements per prd.md, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish by running project lint and type-check
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: Tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-implement` sub-agent and must implement directly, not spawn another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The platform prelude auto-handles the context load requirement:
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and injects the referenced spec files into the agent prompt
- Injects prd.md content

1. Load the `trellis-before-dev` skill to read project guidelines
2. Read `{TASK_DIR}/prd.md` for requirements
3. Consult materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`
4. Implement the code per requirements
5. Run project lint and type-check

#### 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`

[Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

Spawn the check sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-check`
- **Task description**: Review all code changes against spec and prd; fix any findings directly; ensure lint and type-check pass
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: Tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-check` sub-agent and must review/fix directly, not spawn another `trellis-check` / `trellis-implement`.

The check agent's job:
- Review code changes against specs
- Auto-fix issues it finds
- Run lint and typecheck to verify

[/Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi]

[Claude Code, codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]

Load the `trellis-check` skill and verify the code per its guidance:
- Spec compliance
- lint / type-check / tests
- Cross-layer consistency (when changes span layers)

If issues are found → fix → re-check, until green.

[/Claude Code, codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Windsurf]

#### 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

- `check` reveals a prd defect → return to Phase 1, fix `prd.md`, then redo 2.1
- Implementation went wrong → revert code, redo 2.1
- Need more research → research (same as Phase 1.2), write findings into `research/`

---

## Phase 3: Finish

Goal: ensure code quality, capture lessons, record the work.

#### 3.1 Quality verification `[required · repeatable]`

Load the `trellis-check` skill and do a final verification:
- Spec compliance
- lint / type-check / tests
- Cross-layer consistency (when changes span layers)

If issues are found → fix → re-check, until green.

#### 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`

If this task involved repeated debugging (the same issue was fixed multiple times), load the `trellis-break-loop` skill to:
- Classify the root cause
- Explain why earlier fixes failed
- Propose prevention

The goal is to capture debugging lessons so the same class of issue doesn't recur.

#### 3.3 Spec update `[when new knowledge surfaced]`

If this task produced knowledge worth keeping — a new pattern or convention, a pitfall you hit, a technical decision — capture it under `.trellis/spec/` (the `trellis-update-spec` skill has the format). Nothing new? Move on; no judgment ceremony needed.

#### 3.4 Commit changes `[required · once]`

The main session drives the commit so `/finish-work` can run cleanly afterwards (work commits first, bookkeeping commits after — never interleaved).

- `git status --porcelain` + `git log --oneline -5`: see what's dirty, match the repo's commit style. Clean tree → skip to 3.5.
- Group the files you edited this session into logical commits and state the plan in user-facing text. Dirty files you did NOT touch this session are listed for the user to include/exclude — **never silently committed**.
- Hard rules: no `git commit --amend`, never push in this step. If the user rejects the plan, let them commit by hand and continue to 3.5.

#### 3.5 Wrap-up reminder

After the above, remind the user they can run `/finish-work` to wrap up (archive the task, record the session).

## Trellis × Ultracode

"Ultracode" is Claude Code's Workflow tool — large-scale parallel agent orchestration. This section is the protocol the `*-ultra` breadcrumbs point to. It lets Trellis fan out research/check across many agents while keeping every Trellis discipline (spec/jsonl context, prd-driven work, commit ownership).

### When it activates

Two channels, either one:

1. **Config-persistent** — `.trellis/config.yaml` sets `ultracode.enabled: true`. `inject-workflow-state.py`'s `resolve_breadcrumb_key` then serves the `planning-ultra` / `in_progress-ultra` breadcrumbs (class-1 platforms only — `claude` / `cursor` / `opencode` / `kiro` / `codebuddy` / `droid`).
2. **Single-turn** — the turn shows an "Ultracode is on" system-reminder even though config is off. The base `planning` / `in_progress` breadcrumbs carry an `**Ultracode**:` fallback line telling you to switch to this protocol for that turn only.

Codex never activates ultracode — its `fork_turns="none"` sub-agent isolation can't fan out, and `resolve_breadcrumb_key` returns in the codex branch first. If the Workflow tool isn't available on your platform, degrade gracefully to several sequential Task/Agent dispatches.

### What fans out

| Phase | Default under ultracode | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1.2 Research | **fan-out** | One `trellis-research` agent per independent angle, in parallel. Each writes its own `{task_dir}/research/*.md`. |
| 2.1 Implement | **single** (default) | Dispatch ONE `trellis-implement`. Fan out only when the prd splits into independent, non-overlapping units (experimental — see Worktree below). |
| 2.2 / 3.1 Check | **fan-out** | Multiple `trellis-check` agents, one per review dimension; the main session reconciles. |
| 3.4 Commit | **main session only** | Never a Workflow agent. Identical to the base flow. |

The discipline is unchanged — fan-out only multiplies *executors*. The prd still drives, the jsonl still defines context, and the main session still owns the commit.

### How a Workflow agent inherits Trellis context

A Workflow `agent()` call does NOT go through the PreToolUse context-injection hook, so the agent receives no `<!-- trellis-hook-injected -->` marker. That is fine: the `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check` / `trellis-research` agent definitions all carry a "Context Loading Protocol" fallback for exactly this case — when the marker is absent, the agent reads `prd.md` + the `*.jsonl` spec files itself from the active task path. (This fallback was written for hook failures — Windows, `--continue` resume, fork distribution — and the Workflow path is just another "no marker" case.)

So every Workflow dispatch prompt MUST start with:

```
Active task: <task path from `task.py current`>
```

passed RELATIVE to repo root. The agent resolves prd/jsonl against its own cwd, which is why **check / research fan-out must run at repo root, not in a worktree** — a worktree cwd may not contain the (possibly uncommitted) task dir.

### Check pipeline template

A minimal `in_progress-ultra` check fan-out. The Workflow JS parser rejects nested template literals and full-width quotes — use plain string concatenation and half-width quotes only.

```javascript
// trellis-check fan-out: parallel review dimensions, main session reconciles.
// <TASK> = repo-root-relative task dir, substituted by the main session.
const TASK = ".trellis/tasks/06-08-example";
const ACTIVE = "Active task: " + TASK + "\n\n";
const dims = [
  { n: "spec",        body: "dimension SPEC COMPLIANCE only. Read " + TASK + "/prd.md and every spec in " + TASK + "/check.jsonl, then git diff and verify the change follows them. Fix directly. No git commit/push/merge. No re-spawn." },
  { n: "cross-layer", body: "dimension CROSS-LAYER DATA FLOW only. Load " + TASK + "/prd.md + check.jsonl specs. Trace changed data across layers; flag type/contract/validation breaks. Fix directly. No git commit. No re-spawn." },
  { n: "security",    body: "dimension SECURITY and RESOURCE SAFETY only. Load " + TASK + "/prd.md. Check authz, injection, leaked secrets, unbounded loops, leaks, money-path correctness. Fix directly. No git commit. No re-spawn." },
  { n: "adversarial", body: "dimension ADVERSARIAL VERIFICATION only. Load " + TASK + "/prd.md. Assume the diff is wrong; build concrete failing/edge inputs and prove pass/fail. REPORT only, do not silent-fix (main reconciles). No git commit. No re-spawn." },
];
const outs = [];
for (const d of dims) {
  outs.push(agent(ACTIVE + "You are trellis-check, " + d.body, { agentType: "trellis-check" }));
}
const results = [];
for (let i = 0; i < dims.length; i++) results.push("### " + dims[i].n + "\n" + (await outs[i]));
return results.join("\n\n");
// main session: merge findings -> fix or dispatch a single trellis-implement ->
// converge green -> Phase 3.4 commit (main-driven).
```

The first three dimensions may fix non-overlapping concerns directly; the adversarial dimension reports only, so concurrent agents never write the same file. If write conflicts are still a concern, make all dimensions report-only and let the main session apply fixes serially.

### Implement worktree fan-out (experimental)

Only when the prd decomposes into independent units. Preconditions: the task dir is **already committed** (so each worktree, cut from a commit, contains `prd.md` + jsonl); each unit gets its own worktree via `isolation: "worktree"`. Agents write but do NOT commit; the main session merges the worktree branches back into the task branch BEFORE the Phase 3.4 commit, so the main working tree is clean for `/trellis:finish-work`. Keep this off unless the user asks for it — most implement work is a single coherent change that should not be force-split.

## Customizing Trellis (for forks)

This section is for developers who want to modify the Trellis workflow itself. All customization is done by editing this file; the scripts are parsers only.

### Changing what a step means

Edit the corresponding step's walkthrough body in the Phase 1 / 2 / 3 sections above. **Critical constraint**: if you change a step's `[required · once]` marker or add a new `[required · once]` step, you MUST also add a matching enforcement line to that phase's base `[workflow-state:STATUS]` tag block **and to each of its active dispatch-mode variants** (`-inline` for codex, `-ultra` for ultracode) — otherwise the per-turn breadcrumb omits the reinforcement on whichever path is served, and the AI silently skips the step. The regression tests assert this for the base and `-ultra` blocks.

There are 8 tag blocks in the `## Phase Index` section above — 4 base blocks plus 4 dispatch-mode variants that `resolve_breadcrumb_key` selects per platform/config (see the **DISPATCH-MODE VARIANTS** note near the top of this file). Only `planning` / `in_progress` have variants; `no_task` / `completed` do not (a missing `*-ultra` / `*-inline` tag falls back to the base via `build_breadcrumb`):

| Scope | Base tag | Active variants |
|---|---|---|
| No active task (before Phase 1) | `[workflow-state:no_task]` | — |
| All of Phase 1 (task created → ready for implementation) | `[workflow-state:planning]` | `planning-inline` (codex), `planning-ultra` (ultracode) |
| Phase 2 + Phase 3.1–3.4 (implementation + check + wrap-up) | `[workflow-state:in_progress]` | `in_progress-inline` (codex), `in_progress-ultra` (ultracode) |
| After Phase 3.5 (archived) | `[workflow-state:completed]` (**currently DEAD**) | — |

### Changing the per-turn prompt text

Directly edit the body of the corresponding `[workflow-state:STATUS]` block. After editing, run `trellis update` (if you're a template maintainer) or restart your AI session (if you're customizing your own project) — no script changes required.

### Adding a custom status

Add a new block:

```
[workflow-state:my-status]
your per-turn prompt text
[/workflow-state:my-status]
```

Constraints:
- STATUS charset: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` (underscores and hyphens allowed, e.g. `in-review`, `blocked-by-team`)
- A lifecycle hook must write `task.json.status` to your custom value, otherwise the tag is never read
- Lifecycle hooks live in `task.json.hooks.after_*` and bind to one of `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`

### Adding a lifecycle hook

Add a `hooks` field to your `task.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "after_finish": [
      "your-script-or-command-here"
    ]
  }
}
```

Supported events: `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`. Note that `after_finish` ≠ a status change (it only clears the active-task pointer); use `after_archive` for "task is done" notifications.

### Full contract

For the workflow state machine's runtime contract, the locations of all status writers, pseudo-statuses (`no_task` / `stale_<source_type>`), the hook reachability matrix, and other deep details, see:

- `.trellis/spec/cli/backend/workflow-state-contract.md` — runtime contract + writer table + test invariants
- `.trellis/scripts/inject-workflow-state.py` — actual parser (reads workflow.md only, no embedded text)
